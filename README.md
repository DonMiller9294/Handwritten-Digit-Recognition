## Description

This repository contains a Python program that showcases handwritten digit recognition using neural networks. The project utilizes the well-known MNIST dataset, comprising 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. By leveraging the power of TensorFlow and Keras, the neural network model is trained to accurately predict the digits present in the images.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: The MNIST dataset is preprocessed to normalize pixel values and prepare them for neural network training.

- Neural Network Model: A simple neural network architecture is implemented using Keras, with one hidden layer to learn the patterns in the digit images.

- Training and Evaluation: The model is trained on the training data and evaluated on the test data to measure its performance and accuracy.

- Visualization: The program provides visualizations of the model's predictions on a few test images, giving insights into its recognition capabilities.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib
```

2. Run the `handwritten_digit_recognition.py` script:

```bash
python handwritten_digit_recognition.py
```

3. Observe the training process and the model's accuracy on the test data.
