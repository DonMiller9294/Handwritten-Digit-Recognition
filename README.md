# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This repository contains a Python program that demonstrates handwritten digit recognition using neural networks. The program utilizes the famous MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. By leveraging TensorFlow and Keras, the neural network model.
